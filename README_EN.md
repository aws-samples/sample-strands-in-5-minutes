# Strands Agents in 5 Minutes / 5分钟上手Strands系列

[中文](README.md) | English

## Project Introduction
Welcome to the "Strands Agents in 5 Minutes" tutorial series! This is a series focused on enhancing users' and developers' ability to build AI Agents. Through concise 5-minute tutorials, you'll quickly master the design, development, integration, and deployment processes of Strands Agents.

## Tutorial Objectives
- Enhance users'/developers' Agent building capabilities through a series of tutorials, ensuring learning continuity
- Master the basic processes of designing, developing, integrating, and deploying Strands Agent applications
- Enable users to independently develop and deploy their own Agent demos
